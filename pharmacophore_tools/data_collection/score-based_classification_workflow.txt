Steps for score-based pharmacophore data collection for classification with SGD LR
==================================================================================

Distance and feature composition data collection
------------------------------------------------
1. Set your CWD to the directory containing subfolders for each receptor.
	a. Each subfolder should contain subfolders containing the 4 generated
	   .ph4 files for each fragment subset (gh, ef, moefrags, etc.)
2. Save and load ph4_feature_composition.svl and ph4_feature_distance_calc.svl.
3. Save and load score_based_data_collection.svl.
	a. You may have to change the 
4. Run the command 'score_based_data_collection [score_type]' where 'score_type'
   is the name of the fragment subset you wish to collect data for ('ef', 'gh').
	a. This command should be run for each fragment subset folder, 5 times
	   if using the 5 fragment subsets originally studied.
5. In each fragment subset subfolder, a database titled 'ph4_distances_composition.mdb'
   will be created. Open this in MOE 2018.01 and copy all data except the 'ani', 'cat',
   and 'aro' fields to an Excel spreadsheet.

Fragment interaction score (s_score) data collection
----------------------------------------------------
1. Save and load s_score_calc_scorebased_dir.svl.
2. Set your CWD to a directory containing subfolders for each fragment subset.
	a. Each subfolder in this directory should contain the .moe files 
	   representing the MCSS fragments used to create specific .ph4
	   files for each fragment subset (suffixed '_fragments.moe')
3. Run the command 's_score_calc_scorebased_dir []' and copy/paste the results
   to your Excel spreadsheet in a new column titled 's_score'.

Pharmacophore hit collection
----------------------------
1. Save and load feature_search_dir_7feats.svl.
2. Set your CWD to a fragment subset folder containing .ph4 files.
3. Run the command feature_search_dir_7feats [compound_db, mseq_field],
   where 'compound_db' is the database you wish to search and 'mseq_field'
   is the field in compound_db containing mseq numbers,
4. Hit numbers can be found in 'ph4_searchlog.txt'. For a specific partial
   match feature number, copy each pharmacophore's hit number to your Excel
   spreadsheet in a new column titled 'Hits'.
